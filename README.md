# BountySeekers
BountySeekers is a plugin that allows players to place/raise bounties on other players in a more vanilla fashion. Instead of using economy systems, the bounties' rewards are items offered by other players. This way, servers without an economy plugin can still have bounties on players!

BountySeekers is available for download both on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bounty-seekers.104963/), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/bountyseekers) and here, on the [releases page](https://github.com/MrKelpy/BountySeekers/releases)!
